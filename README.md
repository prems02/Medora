# 🩺 Medora - AI-Powered Virtual Clinic Assistant

> Transforming Indian healthcare through real-time AI conversational calls and I-EHR integration 💚

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Doctors waste valuable time in preliminary interviews of patients and lack quick access to patient medical history. With 50+ daily patients, doctors lose 5-6 minutes per patient on repetitive questioning, totaling 250+ precious minutes that could be spent on actual treatment.

## 💡 Our Solution - MEDORA AI Assistant

We built an AI-powered Virtual Clinic Assistant that transforms Indian healthcare through real-time AI conversational calls and I-EHR (Indian Electronic Health Records) integration.

**MEDORA** conducts automated preliminary patient interviews via smart live calls, collecting symptoms and medical history. It instantly generates structured summaries for doctors, eliminating 5-6 minutes of questioning time per patient.

## 🚀 Key Features

- ✨ **AI-Powered Preliminary Assessment** - Comprehensive 2-3 minute interviews using trained medical datasets
- 📋 **Patient-Controlled EHR Integration** - Lifetime medical history database with selective document sharing
- 🏥 **Smart Scheduling System** - Dual-portal with clinic discovery and doctor verification
- 🔒 **ABDM-Compliant Security** - Healthcare data protection aligned with Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission
- ⚡ **Time Efficiency** - Reduces preliminary assessment from 5-6 minutes to 20-25 seconds
