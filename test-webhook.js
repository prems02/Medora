AI Doctor: I understand you've been having headaches for a week. Can you describe the pain - is it constant or comes and goes?

Patient: It comes and goes, but it's really bad when it happens. The pain is like a throbbing sensation, mostly on the right side of my head.

AI Doctor: Thank you for that information. On a scale of 1-10, how severe would you rate the pain?

Patient: I'd say it's about an 8 out of 10 when it's at its worst. It's really affecting my daily life.

AI Doctor: That sounds quite severe. Have you tried any medications or remedies for these headaches?

Patient: Yes, I've tried ibuprofen and acetaminophen, but they only provide temporary relief for about an hour or two.

AI Doctor: I see. Have you noticed any triggers? Things like stress, changes in sleep patterns, certain foods, or visual disturbances?

Patient: Now that you mention it, I have been under a lot of stress at work lately. I've also been getting less sleep - maybe 4-5 hours a night instead of my usual 7-8.

AI Doctor: Those are important factors. Have you experienced any nausea, vomiting, or sensitivity to light or sound with these headaches?

Patient: Yes! I do feel nauseous sometimes, and bright lights make it worse. I usually have to lie down in a dark room.

AI Doctor: Have you had headaches like this before, or is this the first time you're experiencing this pattern?

Patient: I've had occasional headaches before, but never this severe or frequent. This is definitely new for me.

AI Doctor: Do you have any family history of migraines or severe headaches?

Patient: My mother gets migraines, and my grandmother did too. I never thought about it being genetic.

AI Doctor: That's very helpful information. Based on what you've shared - the throbbing pain, nausea, light sensitivity, family history, and stress triggers - this sounds like it could be migraine headaches. However, given the severity and new onset, I strongly recommend you see a healthcare provider in person for proper evaluation and treatment. They may want to do some tests and can prescribe more effective migraine medications.`,
